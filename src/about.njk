            <div class="text-section">
                As President of Mojo CFO, Joe leads a team of Fractional CFOs to support
                value-oriented leaders across businesses and organizations in America.
                <br><br>
                Raised in a rural town in Western Maryland on a hundred-plus acre Black
                Angus
                Cattle Farm, Joe was brought up with core values that align with Mojo
                CFO’s
                approach to business. Honesty, transparency, hard work, persistence and
                service
                are at the heart of everything we do. As the President of Mojo CFO,
                Joe heads the firm’s finance and accounting advisory service lines.
                <br><br>
                He brings his wealth of experience and expertise to the table when crafting
                full service custom finance and accounting solutions in simple and even the most challenging
                circumstances. He seeks to effectively help create more free time, more profits
                and more overall prosperity for the clients he serves. Joe’s background and experience spans
                across working in a number of different roles in finance or accounting capacity including as a full
                time, interm or
                fractional CFO for a number of different organizations. Professionally, he has managed
                accounting and financial operations for organizations to ensure compliance, accuracy and optimal
                success. To date, he has personally worked with dozens of clients,
                supporting companies with annual revenues ranging from $1 million to $100 million.
                <br><br>
                Beyond that, he is deeply committed to community service and development. Under his
                leadership, Mojo CFO donates 10% of its profits to support local non-profits, churches
                and charities to
                further the work of these organizations within our communities. Throughout the year, Joe
                splits time between South Florida and Southern Maryland, where he studied
                International Business & Finance at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the
                University of Maryland.
                <br><br>
                In his free time, Joe enjoys getting outdoors, hunting, fishing, boating and more, but
                more than
                anything, spending time with his friends, family and his dog, a Golden Retriever named
                Millie.
