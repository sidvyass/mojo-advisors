                He brings his wealth of experience and expertise to the table when crafting
                custom finance and accounting solutions in simple and even the most challenging
                circumstances. He seeks to effectively help create more free time, more profits
                and more prosperity for the clients he serves. Joe’s background and experience spans
                across working as a full-time, interim or
                fractional CFO for a number of different organizations. Professionally, he has managed
                financial operations for organizations to ensure compliance, accuracy and efficient
                financial operations. To date, he has personally worked with dozens of clients,
                supporting companies with annual revenues ranging from $1 to $100 million.
                <br><br>
                Beyond that, he is deeply committed to community service and development. Under his
                leadership, Mojo CFO donates 10% of its profits to support local non-profits, churches
                and charities to
                further the work of these organizations within our communities. Throughout the year, Joe
                splits time between South Florida and Southern Maryland, where he studied
                International Business & Finance at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the
                University of Maryland.
                <br><br>
                In his free time, Joe enjoys getting outdoors, hunting, fishing, boating and more, but
                more than
                anything, spending time with his friends, family and his dog, a Golden Retriever named
                Millie.
