                        CFO Services provide strategic financial guidance typically offered by a
                        Chief Financial Officer, but on an outsourced or part-time basis. These
                        services include financial planning, budgeting, forecasting, cash flow
                        management and performance analysis. They are ideal for small to
                        medium-sized businesses, startups, or organizations that need high-level
                        financial expertise without hiring a full-time CFO. We provide CFO support services as well as a
                        full finance and accounting solution for one flat rate.

                        Traditional accounting focuses only on analyzing historical data. Our CFO Services are both

                        with an emphasis on strategic planning, financial analysis and growth-oriented decision-making.
                        While bookkeepers and accountants only record and report, our finance and accounting
                        professionals not only do this but also help you plan and achieve your organization's
